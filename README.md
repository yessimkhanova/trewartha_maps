# Threwartha Climate Classification Maps

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The classification algorithm, particularly for the Threwartha Climate Classification, is still undergoing refinement and may be subject to minor corrections. However, the overall methodology and all data preprocessing steps are fully documented and explained in the related repository: [K√∂ppen Climate Map Generator](https://github.com/yessimkhanova/koppen_maps).

This repository is part of a broader doctoral research effort and is closely related to the [K√∂ppen Climate Map Generator](https://github.com/yessimkhanova/koppen_maps) project. It presents methods and applications for generating Threwartha Climate Classification maps using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and multiple climate datasets.

## Background

The project is conducted by **Kalamkas Yessimkhanova** under the supervision of **Dr. Matyas Gede** at **E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University**, Budapest. It focuses on classifying the climate of Kazakhstan and globally using the Threwartha system, complementing the K√∂ppen-based analysis in the related repository.

## Overview of the K√∂ppen Climate Map Generator

The linked [K√∂ppen Climate Map Generator](https://github.com/yessimkhanova/koppen_maps) project uses GEE and various datasets to create K√∂ppen Climate Classification maps. The generation process depends on the source of climate data and follows two distinct approaches:

### 1. **Earth Engine Dataset Collection (ERA5-Land, CMIP6):**
- Update the collection path and band names.
- Modify units and metadata if needed.

### 2. **Uploaded Asset Data (CRU, preprocessed CMIP6):**
- Filter datasets by scenario and time range.
- Adjust band names, units, and metadata.
- Preprocess CMIP6 into ensemble monthly mean temperature and precipitation sum, followed by multiband image creation and classification.

## How to Use

To replicate or modify the climate classification process:
- Load your preferred dataset (Earth Engine or uploaded).
- Adjust script parameters (band names, time range, units).
- Follow preprocessing steps if needed (for CMIP6). See the "K√∂ppen Climate Map Generator" repository
- Run classification logic using the implemented GEE scripts.
